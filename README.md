# Snake Game

This is the name of the project.

# Description:

Snake game allows users to control the movement of a snake on a screen, to get points for eating food, and avoiding running into walls or the growing tail of the snake itself.This is a game where a graphical representation of a snake moves across the screen. When it encounters a piece of food, the snake grows longer, the snake's speed increases and the user gains a point. If it hits the wall or runs into itself, the snake dies.

# Application's features:

- Play Snake Button.
- The Snake Grid System.
- Displaying Food Item on the Snake Grid.
- A Moving Snake - Graphical representation of a snake.
- Directions to the snake must be given using arrow keys.
- The Snake must grow every time when eats food.
- Game Over conditions - crossing the boundaries ends the game.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
